Recently, I’ve developed a keen interest in creating TUI (Text User Interface) applications, which has become one of my favorite areas of exploration. My current project involves converting full-featured applications, like Spotify, into streamlined TUI versions.</p>
    <p class="body">While I enjoy building applications, my true passion lies in refining them—making them bug-free, accessible, and user-friendly. This attention to detail extends to my other projects, such as creating a comprehensive tutorial for installing and maintaining Arch Linux. I’ve focused on breaking down each step in detail to help users overcome challenges with confidence.</p>
    <p class="body">I’m always eager to experiment, learn new development techniques, and explore innovative approaches in the world of Computer Science.</p>
